    "# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** \n",
    "***\n",
    "In this project, you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson to identify lane lines on the road.  You can develop your pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip \"raw-lines-example.mp4\" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like after using the helper functions below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a result that looks roughly like \"raw-lines-example.mp4\", you'll need to get creative and try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines.  You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video \"P1_example.mp4\".  Ultimately, you would like to draw just one line for the left side of the lane, and one for the right.\n",

Think about defining a line to run the full length of the visible lane based on the line segments you identified with the Hough Transform.  Modify your draw_lines function accordingly and try re-running your pipeline.**"

    "Some possible improvements to this algorithm\n",
    "1) Make it less dependent on absolute pixel positioning: the tuning variables for the region of interest and Hough transform are based on absolute pixel values. This will depend considerably on the setup, e.g. the camera's resolution and its positioning. It would be better to consider how the actual environmental setup (e.g. length of lanes) will translate into pixels according to a camera model. This would lead to a more generally applicable algorithm.\n",
    "2) Lane tracking: in order to better track the lanes and avoid jumpy behavior of lanes, it would be better to track these features using a tracking filter, that takes into account how fast the car is moving and how fast a change in lane direction can be expected between frames. This can also be used to reduce the amount of clutter data by considering data association.\n",
    "3) Geometrical features: while a straight line model is simple, it does not represent the lanes during turns. Considering a lane model that admits curves could lead to better performance. In fact, it is possible to use more geometric information to improve the algorithm, e.g. that the lanes are symmetric or that they are located within the same height (depending on the camera location relative to the car). Estimating the entire area between the lanes instead of the lanes themselves could possibly be better since more pixels (information) can be considered.\n",
    "4) Road segmentation: in order to remove the effects of the background, it would be useful to detect the limits of the road, leading to a more appropriate region of interest. This can possibly be done considering features of the road such as color and homogeneity. \n",
    "5) Car detection: to avoid creating lines over the cars, it would be good to remove the pixels where cars have been detected."
